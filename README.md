# maze-solver
This program solves the mazes by using recursion and backtracking. There are 7 mazes in the folder *test_files* to test the program on. 
- When the maze has a solution, the program returns the solved path of the maze. 
- When the maze does not have a solution, the program returns back the error message.

## Building
- Clone/Download the repository
- To test a particular maze to find its solution, run the file maze_solver.py
- To test all the files at once, run test.py
